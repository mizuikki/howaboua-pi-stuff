name: skill-creator
description: Designs, writes, refactors, and packages agent skills for a workspace. Use when the user asks to create a new skill, improve an existing `SKILL.md`, tighten trigger descriptions, split heavy detail into `references/` or `scripts/`, add examples or validation, or port a workflow into a reusable skill. Do not use for one-off prompt tweaks, strict deployment runbooks, or vague workflows that are not repeatable yet.

# Skill Creator

## Purpose
Use this skill to build or improve reusable skills for a workspace without turning them into bloated promptware. A good skill should trigger cleanly, stay operational, keep its frontmatter lean, act when the path is clear, and troubleshoot only when reality actually breaks.

## When to use
- The user wants a new skill for a recurring workflow.
- An existing `SKILL.md` is too vague, too robotic, too bloated, or triggers badly.
- A workflow needs better boundaries, validation, examples, or output contracts.
- A skill should be split into `SKILL.md` plus `references/` and possibly `scripts/`.
- A copied external skill needs to be adapted to the target workspace instead of imported raw.
- A skill is too eager to troubleshoot, too eager to preflight, or too willing to become doctrine.

## Do not use when
- The workflow is still unclear, one-off, or not actually repeatable.
- The task is really just a direct doc edit with no reusable workflow behind it.
- The target is a strict deployment/runbook doc where warmth or abstraction would make it worse.
- The user only wants a tiny local prompt tweak rather than a portable skill.

## Inputs expected
### Required
- The workflow or problem the skill should handle.
- The target skill path or enough context to infer it.

### Optional
- Existing `SKILL.md` to improve.
- Reference docs, example prompts, or upstream skills to adapt.
- Whether the skill should stay minimal or include `references/` / `scripts/`.

## Prerequisites
- Read `references/skills-reference-guide-for-agents.md` before authoring or heavily restructuring a skill.
- Prefer exact paths and existing workspace conventions over invented structure.

## Workflow
1. **Confirm the task deserves a skill.**
   - A skill is warranted when the workflow recurs, has recognizable steps, and output quality improves when structure is reused.
   - If the workflow is still mushy, tighten the use cases before writing anything.

2. **Map the real trigger boundary.**
   - Define what the skill does, when it should load, and when it should stay quiet.
   - Write the description from user intent, not internal architecture.
   - Add negative scope when over-triggering is likely.

3. **Design the smallest shape that will work.**
   - Default to one `SKILL.md`.
   - Add `references/` only when detailed material would bloat the main file.
   - Add `scripts/` only when deterministic validation or transformation is genuinely better in code.
   - Do not add folders just to look sophisticated.

4. **Draft the frontmatter last, but keep it lean.**
   - Default to only `name` and `description` unless extra fields are truly justified.
   - Keep the description trigger-rich and compact.
   - Avoid architecture-centred or product-marketing wording.

5. **Write the operational body.**
   - Include the core job, boundaries, expected inputs, workflow, validation, error handling, output contract, and a few realistic examples.
   - Keep the step order explicit.
   - Put critical rules near the top.
   - Prefer exact file paths when pointing to supporting material.

6. **Bake in workspace style deliberately.**
   - Assume availability first; do the normal thing before opening a troubleshooting box.
   - Troubleshooting commands belong in a separate reference when possible, and should be read only when failure actually appears.
   - If the path is clear and low-risk, act first instead of over-asking.
   - Ask before destructive or high-blast-radius changes.
   - Match the target workspace tone: warm where collaboration benefits, crisp where procedure matters.

7. **When trigger quality feels off, correct it by feel first.**
   - If a user says a skill does not trigger well enough, assume the description is too vague, too timid, or missing the actual user phrasing.
   - Tighten or broaden the `description` using the way users naturally ask for the thing.
   - Add negative scope if the skill is barging in where it should stay quiet.
   - Do not default to elaborate eval harnesses or benchmark theater unless the user explicitly wants that.
   - Make the trigger sentence sharper, then let real use tell us if it still misses.

8. **Validate the skill against the guide and the target workspace.**
   - Trigger boundary is clear.
   - Frontmatter is slim.
   - Workflow is ordered.
   - References are exact and only loaded when needed.
   - It does not turn every task into diagnostics-first ritual.
   - It does not become doctrine when a bounded tool would do.

8. **Ship the skill cleanly.**
   - Create or update the files directly when the target path and intent are obvious.
   - Summarize what was created or changed and why.
   - If useful, call out the trigger sentence so it is easy to sanity-check.

## Validation
- The skill solves a recurring workflow, not a one-off.
- The description states what it does, when to use it, and when not to use it if overlap is likely.
- Frontmatter is not bloated.
- `SKILL.md` stays operational; heavy detail is moved out.
- The workflow does the normal thing first and troubleshoots only on pain.
- If trigger quality was the complaint, the description was adjusted directly instead of disappearing into evaluation machinery.
- Examples are concrete enough to teach the shape.
- File paths in references are exact.

## Error handling
### Error: workflow is too vague
Action: reduce it to 2-3 concrete use cases before drafting the skill.

### Error: over-triggering or under-triggering risk
Action: tighten or broaden the description with explicit examples and exclusions.

### Error: main file is getting bloated
Action: move factual detail or edge cases into `references/`.

### Error: deterministic check is too fuzzy in prose
Action: move that check into `scripts/` only if the repeatable logic really benefits from code.

### Error: copied external skill is preachy or tool-religious
Action: keep the useful workflow, delete the doctrine.

## Output contract
A completed skill-creation pass should leave:
- a valid `SKILL.md` in the right folder
- any needed `references/` or `scripts/` files
- a clear trigger description
- explicit boundaries and workflow
- a concise summary of what changed and why

## Examples
### Example 1
User says: "Make me a skill for turning recurring repo spelunking into a reusable workflow."

Expected behaviour:
1. Confirm the workflow is recurring.
2. Read the skills guide.
3. Draft a minimal skill with a sharp trigger boundary.
4. Add references only if the main file starts getting fat.

### Example 2
User says: "This skill is too robotic and keeps running diagnostics first. Fix it."

Expected behaviour:
1. Read the existing skill.
2. Identify the diagnostics-first smell.
3. Split troubleshooting into a separate reference if needed.
4. Rework the default workflow so it tries the normal path first.

### Example 3
User says: "Port this upstream skill, but make it fit this workspace."

Expected behaviour:
1. Extract the real workflow from the upstream material.
2. Keep the useful patterns.
3. Remove doctrinal, bloated, or tool-religious framing.
4. Rebuild it with the workspace trigger style, boundaries, and operating posture.
