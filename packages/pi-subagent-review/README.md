# pi-subagent-review

`@howaboua/pi-subagent-review` is a Pi extension that adds one slash command:

- `/review`
- `/review loop`

It runs an isolated review subagent against your current repo, optionally prepares a compact conversation-context summary first, injects the findings back into the session as a user message, and asks the main agent to triage those advisory findings before deciding what to address. It is modelled after Codex CLI's /review command.

## What it does

`/review`:
- detects the current git repo
- chooses a base branch automatically
- computes the merge base with `HEAD`
- if no usable base branch or merge base exists, reviews the current checkout as-is
- if the checkout is clean and has no diff against the selected base, reviews the latest commit instead of stopping early
- inspects committed and dirty worktree changes
- summarizes the current Pi session branch as review context, when enabled
- runs an isolated review subagent
- sends the findings back into the current Pi session as a user message
- makes clear that the findings are advisory, not direct user instructions, so the main agent should triage them against prior context before editing

`/review loop` starts a review loop. It sets a review-specific marker at the current conversation point, strips the `loop` word from the review guidance, and then runs the normal review.

The first `/review` in a session branch also adds a visible advisory preface without starting an agent turn. The preface tells the main agent not to treat review findings as a TODO list, and to summarize and triage them against session context and the current implementation before changing code.

After that, plain `/review` detects the active review marker, summarizes the work since that marker back into a compact review-fix increment, advances the review marker, and then runs the next isolated review pass from the compacted point. If the stored marker is gone, `/review` simply behaves like a normal review.

The review marker is separate from `@howaboua/pi-auto-trees`' generic `/marker`, so both extensions can be used in the same session.

While `/review` is running, the extension shows a small review widget above the editor with one of two states:

- `Preparing review context…`
- `Reviewing changes…`

The widget is UI-only and is cleared when the command finishes, fails, or is cancelled.

## Automatic base branch selection

The command chooses the base branch automatically:

- if you are on a branch other than `main`, `master`, or `dev`, it reviews against `dev`
- if no local `dev` exists, it falls back to `main`, then `master`
- if you are on `dev`, it reviews against `main`, then `master`
- if you are on `main` or `master`, it prefers `dev` when available

This means you usually never need to specify the diff base manually.

## User arguments

Anything after `/review` is treated as extra review guidance.

If the first word is `loop` in any casing, it starts review-loop mode and that word is removed from the review guidance.

Examples:

```text
/review
/review loop
/review LoOp focus extra attention on migrations and tests
/review focus extra attention on migrations and tests
/review assess whether we introduced new UI elements instead of reusing established components and existing CSS patterns
```

## Config

On first load, the extension creates:

- `~/.pi/agent/pi-subagent-review.json`

If Pi is using a custom agent directory via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, the file is created there instead.

Edit that file to change the default review model or thinking level, and the model used to summarize conversation context before review:

```json
{
  "model": "openai-codex/gpt-5.5",
  "thinking": "medium",
  "summary": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini",
    "thinking": "low"
  }
}
```

The summary model uses the same `provider/model` string format as the reviewer model. The generated summary is injected into the isolated review task as branch-style context; raw conversation turns are not sent to the review subagent. If the configured review or summary model is not available for the user, `/review` falls back to the current session model automatically. If conversation summarization still fails, `/review` continues with a diff-only review.

Existing config files from older versions are migrated on load. If a config has `model` and `thinking` but no `summary` block, the extension adds one using the same model and low thinking:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "<existing review model>",
    "thinking": "low"
  }
}
```

If a `summary` block already exists, it is left unchanged.

## Install

Installation methods:

```bash
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-subagent-review
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-subagent-review
pi install git:github.com/IgorWarzocha/pi-subagent-review
```

Then reload or restart Pi.

## Notes

- This extension registers `/review`.
- Do not load it together with another extension that also registers `/review` unless you intentionally want that command collision.
