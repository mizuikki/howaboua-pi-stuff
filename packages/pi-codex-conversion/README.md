# pi-codex-conversion

> [!NOTE]
> This version is a major rewrite. If you hit regressions, reinstall the last pre-rewrite build with `pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion@1.5.21` and please report the issue.

GPT/Codex models are strongest when the tool surface looks like the Codex CLI they were trained around: shell commands, resumable terminal sessions, and patch-based edits. This extension brings that workflow to Pi while keeping Pi's runtime, sessions, project context, skills, and UI. You can now choose whether the built-in tool surface stays Pi-native or switches to the Codex-shaped toolkit. For the brave, Codex PATH mode shifts the toolkit into Pi's internal PATH, instead of the JSON-defined tool schema.

Tool execution uses bundled Rust helpers for better process isolation and lower Pi runtime blast radius; see [Why bundled Rust tools?](#why-bundled-rust-tools). PATH mode exposes extra Codex tools as shell commands on an extension-injected internal PATH; see [PATH_TOOLS.md](./PATH_TOOLS.md).

PATH mode is very likely to consume less tokens, but YMMV. The system prompt has been tweaked to enable GPT models to one-shot call tools, even when they don't have a JSON schema definition. Any suggestions or tweaks are welcome! The whole point is that if the agent fails a tool call because it "didn't know the tool", this mode loses its advantages. It's been tested and it's working, but edge cases may still exist.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion
```

## What changes in Pi

- Codex runtime features activate automatically for OpenAI `gpt*` and `codex*` models, then restore the previous tool set when you switch away.
- The built-in tools surface can stay Pi-native or switch to Codex. Codex prompt/tool guidance is only injected when the Codex tool surface is selected.
- Shell activity is rendered with Codex-like labels such as `Ran`, `Explored`, `Read`, and background-terminal status.
- PATH image outputs from `view_image` and `imagegen` render inline in chat.
- Raw command output is still available by expanding the tool result.

## Built-in tools surfaces

### Pi built-in tools

Pi tools mode keeps Pi's native built-ins:

- `read`
- `bash`
- `edit`
- `write`

Optional extras can still be layered on when enabled and supported:

- `web_run` — web search through the bundled Rust web tool
- `imagegen` — Codex-backed image generation and image edits
- `view_image` — only when explicitly added as an extra or when text-model image descriptions are enabled
- `apply_patch` — only when explicitly added as an extra

In this mode, Pi keeps its native prompt/tool guidance. The extension still applies Codex runtime features such as request shaping, `fast`, and native compaction when the current model/provider is in scope.

### Codex built-in tools

Codex normal mode keeps the familiar Pi function-tool surface:

- `exec_command` — shell execution with Codex-style `cmd` parameters and resumable sessions
- `write_stdin` — continue or poll a running exec session; omitted when Background shell sessions is off
- `apply_patch` — patch edits through the bundled Rust patch tool
- `view_image` — inspect local images through the bundled Rust image tool when the model supports image input
- `web_run` — web search through the bundled Rust web tool when enabled and supported
- `imagegen` — Codex-backed image generation and image edits through the bundled Rust image generation tool when enabled and supported

For configured `openai-responses` providers, `web_run` uses that provider's `/responses` endpoint and API key. Configure this in the settings UI with `Web search auth` plus `Additional providers`.

Codex PATH mode narrows the structured tool surface to shell control only:

- `exec_command` — shell execution with Codex-style `cmd` parameters and resumable sessions
- `write_stdin` — continue or poll a running exec session; omitted when Background shell sessions is off

In PATH mode, Codex-style extras live on the extension-injected internal PATH:

- `apply_patch` — patch edits
- `view_image` — inspect local images
- `web_run` — web search
- `imagegen` — Codex-backed image generation and image edits

Notably for the Codex tool surface:

- there is **no** dedicated `read`, `edit`, or `write` tool in Codex mode
- local text-file inspection should happen through `exec_command`
- file creation and edits should default to `apply_patch`; in PATH mode that is the shell command
- in PATH mode, image/web tools run through `exec_command` as PATH tools, not Pi function tools
- Pi may still expose additional runtime tools such as `parallel`; the prompt is written to tolerate that

## PATH mode examples

These commands run inside `exec_command` when PATH mode is enabled.

```bash
view_image '{"path":"/x.png"}'
web_run '{"search_query":[{"q":"..."}],"response_length":"short"}'
imagegen '{"prompt":"..."}'
imagegen '{"action":"edit","prompt":"...","images":["https://... or /x.png"]}'
```

For quote-heavy JSON, pass JSON through stdin:

```bash
imagegen <<'JSON'
{"prompt":"keep the creature's original style"}
JSON
```

Generated images are saved under `.pi/openai-codex-images/` at the workspace/repo root, with the latest image mirrored to `latest.png`.

## Settings

Use `/codex` to change adapter settings.

- `/codex all` — use the Codex tool and prompt adapter on every model
- `/codex status` — toggle the footer/statusline entry
- `/codex fast` — toggle priority service tier for the OpenAI Codex provider
- `/codex compact` — open native compaction settings
- `/codex usage` — show Codex subscription usage windows for the active OpenAI Codex model
- `/codex reset` — open the Usage tab, where banked rate-limit resets can be used with Ctrl+R
- `/codex low`, `/codex medium`, `/codex high` — set Responses API verbosity
- `/codex ps` — show the background shell widget

Settings are saved globally in `~/.pi/agent/pi-codex-conversion.json`.

The settings UI has **General**, **Tools**, **OpenAI**, **Usage**, and **About** tabs. **Usage** refreshes automatically when opened, can be refreshed manually with `R`, and shows banked Codex rate-limit resets with their expiry above the usage windows. When resets are available, press `Ctrl+R` in the Usage tab to use one. After a reset attempt, press `R` before using another reset.

**General** controls the built-in tools surface (`pi`, `codex`, or `codex path`), scope, status UI, background shells, and whether native Responses compaction is enabled. Native compaction applies to OpenAI Codex and explicitly added providers; all-model scope only changes the tool surface and Codex runtime feature scope. `codex path` switches the Codex surface to the shell-only structured surface above.

Advanced users with custom Codex-compatible providers can add provider ids in General, or by editing `~/.pi/agent/pi-codex-conversion.json`:

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "additionalProviders": ["my-provider"]
  }
}
```

**Tools** shows the current shell/edit/image behavior for the selected built-in tools surface, plus background shell sessions and optional web/image/apply-patch extras. **OpenAI** controls fast mode, verbosity, cached WebSocket upgrade, web search model, and compaction model/reasoning.

- `webSearchModel` accepts `current`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, or `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. The default is `gpt-5.4-mini`.
- `compactionModel` accepts the same values. `current` keeps native Responses compaction on the active session model instead of forcing a separate compaction model.

The footer shows the active state, for example:

```text
Codex adapter V: low • fast
```

## Why bundled Rust tools?

The bundled tools are not only for Codex-shaped PATH mode. They also reduce the blast radius of heavy tool work.

If a Pi-native TypeScript tool allocates too much memory, blocks the runtime, or crashes badly, it can take the Pi process with it. When a bundled Rust tool fails, it usually fails as a child process: TypeScript reports a tool error, Pi stays alive, and the agent can retry or choose another path.

That matters most for process control, PTYs, patch application, image handling, and large command outputs. TypeScript still owns the Pi-facing parts: JSON schemas, model/auth gating, result conversion, rendering, and deciding what enters chat history.

## Details worth knowing

- `exec_command` and `write_stdin` use a bundled Rust exec bridge when the Codex tool surface is selected; `tty: true` runs through a PTY for interactive commands.
- Background shell sessions can be turned off in Tools; `write_stdin` is deactivated and long commands are terminated instead of returning a `session_id`.
- Codex PATH mode prepends the package `bin` directory to exec session `PATH` so bundled Codex tools are available in shell commands.
- `imagegen` waits up to five minutes in a foreground `exec_command` call before falling back to a resumable session.
- The package includes bundled binaries and vendored Rust source for the PATH tools.
- If native compaction fails, the extension falls back to Pi's normal compaction flow. When an older native compacted window exists, it is included in that Pi fallback summarization request so OpenAI can still use the prior opaque context server-side.

## Command rendering examples

- `rg -n foo src` -> `Explored / Search foo in src`
- `rg --files src | head -n 50` -> `Explored / List src`
- `cat README.md` -> `Explored / Read README.md`
- `npm test` -> `Ran npm test`
- `write_stdin({ session_id, chars: "" })` -> `Waited for background terminal`
- `write_stdin({ session_id, chars: "y\n" })` -> `Interacted with background terminal`

## Development checkout

The Git checkout is mostly for development and mirrors the maintainer workflow. It uses committed binaries; rebuild local-platform binaries only after changing Rust source.

Published installs include prebuilt native binaries. For best compatibility on older Linux systems, or if a bundled tool fails with a loader error such as `GLIBC_2.39 not found`, use a Git checkout and build the tools on that machine instead of upgrading glibc manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/pi-codex-conversion
bun install
bun run build:path-tool codex-exec-shim exec_bridge
```

Run the current checkout without installing globally:

```bash
pi --no-extensions --no-skills -e /path/to/pi-codex-conversion
```
